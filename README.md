# Emojifier
real-time emojifier

written in autohotkey

the executable will throw warnings, because the script contains keyboard hooks, download only if you know what you're doing
if you are familiar with autohotkey, you can also download the source code

after running the script, an icon will pop up in your task bar, you can either pause or exit the script by right-clicking it

right now it's only a small project that I've written in a couple hours, so don't expect miracles. I'll continue working on it if enough people are interested
